# üß† Experience Report ‚Äì ResNet + YOLO Object Detection

## üîç Project Summary
This project involved building an object detection model by integrating a YOLO-style detection head with a ResNet backbone and training it on a COCO-format dataset. The objective was to understand object detection fundamentals and explore how AI tools can support development.

---

## üí° Challenges Faced

- **Understanding YOLO Output Structure**: Getting the grid-cell-based structure and anchor box logic to align with the COCO format was tricky.
- **Loss Function Implementation**: YOLO-style loss calculation is complex due to objectness, class, and bounding box regression components.
- **Data Loader for COCO-YOLO Format**: Custom parsing of label files in YOLO format took time to get right with resizing and matching boxes.

## ü§ñ Use of AI Tools

- **ChatGPT**: Used to guide implementation of the YOLO head on ResNet, clarify how to reshape final layers, and understand NMS and anchor box logic.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Assisted in writing PyTorch training and evaluation boilerplate.
- **Stack Overflow + Docs**: Referenced solutions for Dataset class handling, loss debugging, and mAP evaluation.

## üìò What I Learned

- Practical working of CNN backbones like ResNet and how feature maps can be extended with custom detection heads.
- The importance of data preprocessing and the impact of correct label formatting.
- Real-world object detection evaluation metrics like mAP, precision, and recall.

## üò≤ What Surprised Me

- The sheer complexity of writing a YOLO model from scratch ‚Äì especially loss functions and post-processing (like NMS).
- How easily AI tools accelerated my progress ‚Äî but also how easy it is to misuse them without proper understanding.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Coding Myself vs. AI Assistance

- **Balanced Approach**: I used AI tools to unblock me when stuck, but I wrote most of the logic after understanding what was required.
- **Code Ownership**: I made sure I understood every line even if it was suggested by AI, to ensure the learning was deep and authentic.

## üß† Suggestions for Improvement

- Provide a baseline or working YOLO head as a reference ‚Äì it will save time and let us focus on integration and debugging.
- Introduce students to simple detection frameworks before jumping into custom builds.

‚úÖ Overall, this project significantly boosted my understanding of computer vision and how to combine traditional deep learning with AI-assisted development.
